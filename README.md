Onion Architecture:
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

No.

Benefits:

Separation of Concerns
Testability
Dependency Inversion Principle
Bottlenecks (Encountered):

Yes. 

One bottleneck encountered was the initial learning curve and the discipline required to strictly follow the architectural boundaries. This can sometimes lead to increased complexity for smaller projects.

MVC Pattern:

Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?

Yes.

Components:

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
View: Renders the user interface based on the data from the model.
Controller: Handles user input, updates the model, and selects the appropriate view.
Bottlenecks (Encountered):

No. 

Tight coupling between the Model and Controller can sometimes lead to challenges in maintaining and testing the application. Changes in business logic often require adjustments in both the model and controller, impacting the overall system.

Web API:

Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?

No.

Differences from MVC:

Yes. 

Web APIs are designed primarily for data exchange and integration purposes, offering a lightweight approach for exposing services and data to other applications. In contrast, traditional MVC applications focus on delivering user interfaces directly to clients.

Bottlenecks (Encountered):

Yes. 

Performance challenges can arise in traditional MVC applications due to frequent page refreshes and full-page rendering. Web APIs, on the other hand, can provide more efficient data transfer methods, especially for scenarios involving complex or frequent data exchanges.
